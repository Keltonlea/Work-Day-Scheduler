# 05 Third-Party APIs: Work Day Scheduler

## About The Project

The goal of this project was to create a simple work day calendar. The scheduler has a row to represent each hour of the typical workday, where the user can enter and save tasks for that given hour. Each hour is color-coded based on whether the event is in the past, present, or future.
